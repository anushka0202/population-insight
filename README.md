- 30-50 Years

### 2. Pie-chart

### 3. Population Table
Shows a simple list of all people. 

### 4. Family Tree
On selection of a row in the Population Table, one should be able to see the family tree. The family tree always starts with the topmost root of that family and highlights the person selected.
